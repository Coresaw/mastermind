mastermind
=========


A simple mastermind game using pyqt5.
Mastermind is a code cracking game. The code consists, in the case of this implementation, of four circles, each of which can be any of six different colors.
The user can assign colors to the circles. When submitting their combination, they will receive clues to gradually guide them to the solution. They will be told how many circles have the right color in the right place, and how many circles have the right color in a wrong place. They will, however, not be told which of the circles correspond to which clue.
The program also currently contains three algorithms to solve the puzzle instead of the user. They are represented by the names Joe, Leyla and Daryl.
